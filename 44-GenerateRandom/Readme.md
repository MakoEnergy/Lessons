Assignment Goals:
1. This is an entirely new assignment, not using any prior code.
2. The program must prompt the user for a number, which must be reasonable.
3. The program must then create an array of that size and populate it with random numbers generated by the C++ <random> library.
4. The program must then print the generated numbers to cout.
5. Lastly the program must clean up.
