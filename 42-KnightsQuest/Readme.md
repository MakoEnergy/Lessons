Assignment Goals:
1. This is an entirely new assignment, not using any prior code.
2. Imagine a chess board (8x8) and a knight chess piece.  You must start in a corner ([0][0]) and land on every square exactly once using the same movement rules as a knight chess piece.  
3. You’ll need to create a multidimensional array to track whether or not you’ve already landed on a square.
4. At the end of the program you need to loop over each element in the multidimensional array to verify if you missed any squares and log to cout which ones you missed.  If you missed none, you can log whatever victory message you want.
5. Clue: You need to take the move with the fewest options.
